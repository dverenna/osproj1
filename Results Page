We plan to run our program multiple times to get various data points, so it will be easy to show results
and any outliers.
Our result section will be broken down into 4 sections:

   1. Comparison of Total System Turnaround Time:
        This section will consist of the average total system turnaround time for all four scenarios.
        A graph (we haven't decided what kind of graph) to display the different ranges for each scenario.
        We would be able to clearly see and highlight anything that is worth noting and is worth further investigation/attetion.
    
   2. Comparison of Average Process Turnaround Time:
        This section would look similar to the first section, but instead of looking at the system,
        we would be examining the individual process turnaround time, and how it varies for each scenario. 
        We would also be able to create a graph and a discussion about how service time, arrival time, and memory requirements
        affect the turnaround time of each process.
        
   3. Comparison of Average Process Wait Time:
        This section would look similar to the other two sections, but it would be looking at the average process wait time.
        We would create a graph for each of the four scenarios and interpret them accordingly.
        
   4. Comparison of Process Schedule Ordering:
        Here we would depict multiple Gant charts for each scenario, depending on how many times we run each scenario.
        A table could also be benficial depicting which process went first, its arrival time, wait time, turnaround time, seed values, and when it finishes.
        A graph may be necessary to show/explore our findings and this section will most likely be where the bulk of our findings are.
        This table would allow us to easily compare the four scenarios and highlight/discuss any important findings.
